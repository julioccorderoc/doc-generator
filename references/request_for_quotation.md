# Request for Quotation (RFQ) — Reference

## §1.1 Document Overview

A Request for Quotation is a document issued by a buyer to one or more vendors, asking them to provide a price for a specific product or service. The issuer describes what they need (specifications, quantities, and requirements); the vendor responds with a quote. No monetary values appear in the RFQ itself.

**Parties:** Issuer (left address block — who is requesting the quote) · Vendor (right address block — who is being asked to quote; optional for broadcast RFQs)

## §1.3 Computed Fields

This document type has **no computed fields**. All values come directly from the payload. No monetary arithmetic is performed.

---

## §1.4 Validation Rules

- `rfq_number` must be a non-empty string (after stripping whitespace)
- `product_name` must be a non-empty string
- `spec_sections` must contain at least one entry
- `valid_until`, if provided, must be strictly after `date`
- `issuer.name` must be a non-empty string
- `vendor.name`, if vendor is provided, must be non-empty

---

## §1.5 Claude Data Collection Protocol

1. **Identify what the user has already provided.** The user may have supplied a product name, some specs, or a partial JSON blob.

2. **Ask for all missing required fields in a single pass:**
   - `rfq_number` — the RFQ identifier
   - `issuer.name` — issuer company name
   - `product_name` — name of the product being quoted
   - `spec_sections` — at least one section with at least one row; this is the main body of the RFQ

3. **Apply these defaults silently (never ask):**
   - `issue_date` → today
   - `product_attributes` → `[]` if not provided
   - `issuer.address`, `issuer.phone`, `issuer.email` → omit if not provided

4. **Never ask for computed fields** — there are none for this doc type.

5. **`valid_until`:** Do **not** ask for this by default. Only include it when the user explicitly mentions a submission deadline or quote expiry date. It exists as an option but is not standard for all RFQs.

6. **`product_description`:** Do **not** ask for this. Only include it if the user volunteers a subtitle or short description for the product. The product name alone is sufficient.

7. **Logo:** Ask only if the user explicitly mentions a logo or branding.

8. **Spec sections guidance:** Encourage the user to group specifications under section headings (e.g. "Formula", "Packaging", "Quality"). If the user provides a flat list of specs, group them under a single unnamed section.

9. **Annexes:** Ask if the user has any reference documents, links, or attachments to include.

10. **Contact block:** Ask if there is a specific contact person for vendor questions (name, email, phone). This is separate from the issuer.

11. **Vendor:** Ask if the RFQ is addressed to a specific vendor, or if it's a broadcast (no vendor block).

12. **Confirm before generating:** Show a summary of the document structure (product, number of spec sections, number of spec rows) and ask the user to confirm before writing the payload.

## §1.6 Example Payload

### Broadcast RFQ (no specific vendor, no submission deadline)

This is the typical case — sent to multiple vendors or shared openly. Use `tests/fixtures/sample_rfq_broadcast.json` as the working example.

```json
{
  "rfq_number": "RFQ-2026-002",
  "issuer": {
    "name": "Natural Cure Labs",
    "address": "P.O. Box 13945\nSt. Petersburg, FL 33733",
    "phone": "+1 (800) 303-6214",
    "email": "info@naturalcurelabs.com"
  },
  "product_name": "Level Off",
  "product_attributes": [
    { "header": "Capsules per bottle", "value": "120" },
    { "header": "Serving size", "value": "2 capsules" },
    { "header": "Volume (bottles)", "value": "4,000" }
  ],
  "spec_sections": [
    {
      "rows": [
        {
          "label": "Formula (per serving)",
          "value": "> 250mg Mulberry Leaf Extract 5% 1-Deoxynojirimycin\n> 250mg Lemon Peel Extract 50% Bioflavonoids\n> 85mg Ceylon Cinnamon 12:1 Extract Bark (Cinnamomum Verum)"
        },
        { "label": "Excipient", "value": "Ascorbyl palmitate" },
        { "label": "Capsule type", "value": "0 veggie" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Packaging",
      "rows": [
        { "label": "Bottle", "value": "250cc white PET bottle" },
        { "label": "Cap", "value": "45mm White Ribbed HS, with special liner (includes foil)" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "notes": "Please include lead time, minimum order quantity, and payment terms in your quote.",
  "contact": {
    "name": "Julio Cordero",
    "email": "julio@naturalcurelabs.com",
    "phone": "+1 (727) 390-3461"
  }
}
```

**Expected output:** Issuer block full-width (no vendor panel), product summary table, spec table with one unnamed section + one "Packaging" section, notes, contact block. No "Valid Until" meta band.

### Addressed RFQ (specific vendor + submission deadline)

Use this form when the RFQ is directed at one vendor and a quote-by date is required. See `tests/fixtures/sample_rfq.json` for the full working example.

```json
{
  "rfq_number": "RFQ-2026-001",
  "issue_date": "2026-01-15",
  "valid_until": "2026-02-15",
  "issuer": { "name": "Natural Cure Labs", "..." : "..." },
  "vendor": {
    "name": "Precision Nutraceuticals Inc.",
    "address": "1200 Industrial Blvd\nTampa, FL 33601"
  },
  "product_name": "Level Off",
  "spec_sections": [ { "rows": [ { "label": "...", "value": "..." } ] } ],
  "annexes": [
    { "title": "Two pack polybag specs", "url": "https://example.com/polybag-specs.pdf" }
  ],
  "contact": { "name": "Julio Cordero", "email": "julio@naturalcurelabs.com" }
}
```

**Expected output:** Two-party address block (issuer left, vendor right), "Valid Until" in the meta band, annexes table.

## §1.7 Payload Construction

### Minimal payload

```json
{
  "rfq_number": "...",
  "issuer": { "name": "..." },
  "product_name": "...",
  "spec_sections": [
    {
      "rows": [
        { "label": "...", "value": "..." }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Field encoding notes

- **Address line breaks:** use `\n` within the string, e.g. `"123 Main St\nCity, ST 12345"`
- **Dates:** `YYYY-MM-DD` format; `issue_date` defaults to today if omitted
- **Multiline spec values:** use `\n` within the value string for multi-line cells (e.g. ingredient lists)
- **`product_attributes`:** omit or `[]` if no summary table columns are needed
- **`vendor`:** omit entirely for broadcast RFQs
- **`spec_sections[*].title`:** omit or set to `null` for an unnamed section (no section header row rendered)
- **`annexes[*].url`:** omit if no URL; title still renders without a URL column
- **Logo:** absolute path or `https://` URL; omit for no logo
- **`primary_color`:** hex string e.g. `"#1A4021"`; omit to use the default green

## §1.8 Document Layout Notes

1. **Header bar** — dark background; logo (left), "REQUEST FOR QUOTATION" label + RFQ number (right). Follows the same structure as `purchase_order.html`.
2. **Meta band** — appears below the header if `valid_until` is set. Shows "Valid Until" label + formatted date on the right side.
3. **Address block** — Issuer (left, always rendered) · Vendor (right, rendered only when `vendor` is present). If no vendor, issuer block takes the full width via CSS class `address-block--single`.
4. **Product summary table** — rendered only when `product_name` is set (always true, as it's required). Columns: "Product" (fixed left column showing `product_name` + optional `product_description`) followed by one column per entry in `product_attributes`. If `product_attributes` is empty, only the product column renders.
5. **Spec table** — full-width two-column table (label left, value right). Section header rows (`title` present) span both columns with a distinct background. Value cells use `white-space: pre-line` to render `\n` as line breaks without HTML conversion.
6. **Notes block** — optional; full-width; renders below the spec table.
7. **Annexes block** — optional; renders as a two-column table (Title | URL). If none of the annexes have a URL, the URL column is omitted.
8. **Contact block** — optional; centered; shows "Questions? Please contact:" label followed by the contact details on one or two lines.
9. **Footer** — standard `doc-footer` bar with issuer name and contact info collapsed to one line.
