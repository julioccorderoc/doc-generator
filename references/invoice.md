# Invoice — Field Reference

This is the source of truth for the `invoice` document type. The Pydantic schema, the Jinja2 template, and Claude's data collection behavior are all derived from this document.

---

## Document Overview

An Invoice is a commercial document issued by an **issuer** (the seller/service provider) to a **client** (the buyer), requesting payment for goods delivered or services rendered. It records what was provided, at what price, and when payment is due.

The issuer is the company sending the invoice. The `bill_to` party is the client being billed. These are conceptually distinct from the PO's buyer/vendor relationship — on an invoice, the issuer is always the one being paid.

## Field Reference

### Top-Level Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `invoice_number` | string | ✅ | — | Unique identifier for this invoice. Format is up to the issuer (e.g. `INV-2026-0001`). Claude should suggest a sequential format if not provided. |
| `issue_date` | date | ✅ | today | Date the invoice is issued. Defaults to today if not specified. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| `due_date` | date | ❌ | — | Payment due date. Optional but strongly recommended. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD`. Must be on or after `issue_date` if provided. |
| `currency` | string | ❌ | `USD` | Currency code. Phase 2 supports USD only. Formatting: `$1,234.56`. |
| `payment_terms` | string | ❌ | — | e.g. `Net 30`, `Due on receipt`, `50% upfront`. Free text. |
| `tax_rate` | number | ❌ | `0.00` | Tax rate as a decimal (e.g. `0.08` for 8%). Applied to subtotal. Must be between `0.0` and `1.0`. |
| `shipping_cost` | number | ❌ | `0.00` | Flat shipping or delivery fee added to the total. In USD. Must be zero or positive. |
| `notes` | string | ❌ | — | General notes, additional terms, or instructions. Renders at the bottom of the document. |
| `paid` | boolean | ❌ | `false` | Whether the invoice has already been paid. If `true`, `amount_paid` should also be provided. |
| `amount_paid` | number | ❌ | `0.00` | Amount already received. Meaningful only when `paid` is `true`. In USD. Must be zero or positive. |
| `primary_color` | string | ❌ | — | Brand color override. Must be a hex color in `#RRGGBB` or `#RGB` format, or a single-word CSS color name (e.g. `"#7c3aed"`, `"#fff"`, `"purple"`). Overrides the header background and primary accent color. |

---

### `issuer` Object — The company sending the invoice

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `issuer.name` | string | ✅ | Legal company name of the issuer. |
| `issuer.address` | string | ✅ | Full mailing address. Can be multiline (use `\n`). |
| `issuer.contact_name` | string | ❌ | Name of the billing contact at the issuer. Displayed below the address. |
| `issuer.email` | string | ❌ | Contact or billing email. |
| `issuer.phone` | string | ❌ | Contact phone number. |
| `issuer.logo` | string | ❌ | Base64 data URI (`data:image/png;base64,...`). Claude reads the file and encodes it before building the payload — never pass a file path or URL. Renders in the document header if provided. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG. |

---

### `bill_to` Object — The client being billed

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bill_to.name` | string | ✅ | Legal company or individual name of the client. |
| `bill_to.address` | string | ✅ | Full mailing address. Can be multiline (use `\n`). |
| `bill_to.contact_name` | string | ❌ | Name of the accounts payable contact at the client. Displayed below the address. |
| `bill_to.email` | string | ❌ | Contact email at the client. |
| `bill_to.phone` | string | ❌ | Contact phone number at the client. |

---

### `line_items` Array — What is being invoiced

Each entry in `line_items` is an object with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `description` | string | ✅ | — | Name or description of the item or service. |
| `quantity` | number | ✅ | — | Quantity delivered or hours worked. Must be greater than zero. Can be decimal (e.g. `2.5` for 2.5 hours). |
| `unit_price` | number | ✅ | — | Price per unit in USD. Must be greater than zero. |
| `unit` | string | ❌ | `units` | Unit label displayed next to quantity. e.g. `units`, `hrs`, `kg`, `days`. |
| `sku` | string | ❌ | — | Product code, SKU, or service reference code. Displayed in the line item row if provided. |
| `count_units` | boolean | ❌ | `true` | Whether to include this item's quantity in `total_units`. Set to `false` for service lines (labour, consulting, setup fees) that should not count toward the physical unit total. |

**Minimum:** 1 line item required.

---

### `payment_details` Array — How to pay (optional)

An optional ordered list of name/value pairs describing how the client should remit payment. Accepts any payment method without hardcoding specific fields. Renders as a labeled block near the bottom of the document.

Each entry:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `label` | string | ✅ | Display label for the field, e.g. `Bank`, `Account Name`, `BSB / Routing`, `Account Number`, `Reference`, `PayPal`. |
| `value` | string | ✅ | The corresponding value, e.g. `Commonwealth Bank of Australia`, `Natural Cure Labs LLC`. |

Examples of complete `payment_details` arrays:

```json
[
  { "label": "Bank", "value": "Chase Bank" },
  { "label": "Account Name", "value": "Natural Cure Labs LLC" },
  { "label": "Routing Number", "value": "021000021" },
  { "label": "Account Number", "value": "123456789" },
  { "label": "Reference", "value": "INV-2026-0001" }
]
```

```json
[
  { "label": "PayPal", "value": "billing@naturalcurelabs.com" }
]
```

If omitted or an empty list, the payment details block is not rendered.

## Computed Fields

These are calculated by the script from the input data. **Never ask the user for these — they are always derived.**

| Field | Formula | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `line_items[n].total` | `quantity × unit_price` | `5 × $200.00 = $1,000.00` |
| `subtotal` | `sum(line_items[n].total)` | `$1,000.00 + $500.00 = $1,500.00` |
| `tax_amount` | `subtotal × tax_rate` | `$1,500.00 × 0.10 = $150.00` |
| `grand_total` | `subtotal + tax_amount + shipping_cost` | `$1,500.00 + $150.00 + $0.00 = $1,650.00` |
| `balance_due` | `grand_total - amount_paid` | `$1,650.00 - $825.00 = $825.00` |
| `total_units` | `sum(quantity for items where count_units = true)` | `50 + 25 = 75` |

All monetary values are rounded to 2 decimal places.

`total_units` is displayed only when at least one line item has `count_units = true`.

`balance_due` equals `grand_total` when `paid = false` (i.e., `amount_paid` is `0.00`).

---

## Validation Rules

- `invoice_number` must be a non-empty string.
- `issue_date` and `due_date` (if provided) must be valid dates. `due_date`, if provided, must be on or after `issue_date`.
- `line_items` must contain at least one item.
- `quantity` and `unit_price` must be positive numbers greater than zero.
- `shipping_cost` must be zero or positive.
- `tax_rate` must be between `0.0` and `1.0`.
- `amount_paid` must be zero or positive. If `paid = true` and `amount_paid` is not provided, it defaults to `0.00` (valid, but Claude should ask).
- `issuer.name`, `issuer.address`, `bill_to.name`, `bill_to.address` are all required and must be non-empty strings.
- `issuer.logo`, if provided, must be a `data:image/...;base64,...` string. File paths and URLs are rejected — Claude must read and encode the file before building the payload.
- `payment_details` entries must each have a non-empty `label` and `value`.

---

## Claude Data Collection Protocol

When a user asks to generate an Invoice, Claude should:

1. **Identify what's already provided** — the user may have given partial information inline (e.g. "invoice for Acme for last month's consulting").
2. **Ask for required fields in one pass** — do not ask field by field. Group all missing required fields into a single request.
3. **Use smart defaults** — apply `issue_date = today`, `currency = USD`, `paid = false`, `amount_paid = 0.00`, `tax_rate = 0.00`, `shipping_cost = 0.00` silently without asking. Suggest `invoice_number` format if missing.
4. **Never ask for computed fields** — do not ask for `subtotal`, `tax_amount`, `grand_total`, `balance_due`, `total_units`, or per-line `total`.
5. **Handle logo gracefully** — if the user mentions a logo, ask for the file path. Use the Read tool to read the file and encode it as a base64 data URI (`data:image/...;base64,...`) before including it in the payload. If they don't mention a logo, do not ask.
6. **Ask about `count_units` for service lines** — if a line item is clearly a service (consulting, setup, labour), ask if it should be excluded from the unit total. Default is `true` (counted); set to `false` to exclude.
7. **Ask about payment details** — prompt the user to provide bank details or other payment instructions if they want them included. If not mentioned, do not force the issue.
8. **Ask about payment status** — if the user indicates partial or full payment has already been received, collect `paid` and `amount_paid` values.
9. **Confirm before generating** — once all required data is collected, show a brief summary and ask for confirmation before invoking the script.

## Payload Construction

### Minimal payload (required fields only)

```json
{
  "invoice_number": "INV-2026-0001",
  "issue_date": "2026-03-16",
  "issuer": {
    "name": "...",
    "address": "..."
  },
  "bill_to": {
    "name": "...",
    "address": "..."
  },
  "line_items": [
    {
      "description": "...",
      "quantity": 1,
      "unit_price": 10.00
    }
  ]
}
```

### Field encoding notes

- **Addresses:** Use `\n` for line breaks (e.g. `"123 Main St\nSuite 4\nNew York, NY"`).
- **Dates:** Always `"YYYY-MM-DD"` string format.
- **Money:** Numbers, not strings. `10.00`, not `"$10.00"`.
- **Computed fields:** Never included in the payload. Omit `subtotal`, `tax_amount`, `grand_total`, `balance_due`, `total_units`, and per-line `total`.
- **Logo:** Must be a base64 data URI (`data:image/...;base64,...`). Claude reads the image file and encodes it before writing the payload — never include a file path or URL. Omit or set to `null` if not provided.

## Document Layout Notes (for template authors)

The invoice template should follow this visual structure, top to bottom:

1. **Header row** — issuer logo (if provided) on the left; document title "INVOICE" + invoice number + issue date on the right. If `paid = true`, render a "PAID" stamp/banner overlaid on or near the header.
2. **Address block** — two columns: "From" (issuer) on the left, "Bill To" (client) on the right. Contact name displayed below address without any prefix.
3. **Meta row** — due date, payment terms in a compact horizontal band (only rendered if at least one is present).
4. **Line items table** — columns: `#` | `SKU` (column omitted entirely if no item has one) | `Description` | `Unit` | `Qty` | `Unit Price` | `Total`.
5. **Bottom section** — two-column layout: Notes (left, optional) and Totals block (right, fixed width). Both always present; Notes column is empty when `notes` is absent.
6. **Totals block** (right column) — a single table containing: `Total Units` (first row, only if any item has `count_units = true`, visually separated by a bottom border) followed by financial rows: Subtotal / Tax (rate%) / Shipping (only if > 0) / Grand Total / Amount Paid (only if `paid = true` or `amount_paid > 0`) / **Balance Due** (bold, prominent).
7. **Payment details block** — full-width section below the bottom row, only rendered if `payment_details` is non-empty. Displays as a two-column key/value table with a distinct background or border. Heading: "Payment Details".
8. **Footer** — full-width dark bar at the bottom of every page. Auto-populated from issuer data: name · address (single line) · phone (if provided) · email (if provided). No additional fields needed. Page number is rendered in the page margin below the footer bar.

**Balance Due emphasis:** `balance_due` is the most important financial figure on the invoice. It should be visually prominent (bold, slightly larger, or with a distinct background row) — more so than on a PO's grand total.

**PAID stamp:** When `paid = true` and `balance_due` equals `0.00`, render a "PAID" visual indicator. A bold green label or diagonal stamp effect in CSS is acceptable. This is purely cosmetic and controlled by the `paid` field.
